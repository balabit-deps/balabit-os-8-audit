audit (1:2.3.2-2ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Migrate from the Ubuntu-specific way of providing a rules directory
    (/etc/audit/rules.d/) to the new, upstream rules directory feature based
    on /sbin/augenrules. If USE_AUGENRULES is set to "yes" in
    /etc/default/auditd, then the auditd init script will use
    /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules files to generate /etc/audit/audit.rules.
    Instead of generating the /etc/audit/audit.rules file, the old
    Ubuntu-specific way of handling a rules directory parsed
    /etc/audit/audit.rules, in addition to the /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules
    files.
    - debian/auditd.preinst, debian/auditd.postinst, debian/auditd.postrm:
      When upgrading from a version without augenrules, check for a
      pre-existing rules directory (/etc/audit/rules.d/). If it exists and is
      populated with rules files, move /etc/audit/audit.rules to
      /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules and set USE_AUGENRULES to "yes". This
      migration logic should be dropped after the 14.04 release.
  * Merge from Debian testing (LP: #1251795). Remaining changes:
    - debian/rules: Disable auditd network listener, with --disable-listener,
      to reduce the risk of a remote attack on auditd, which runs as root
    - debian/control, debian/rules: Remove libwrap0-dev Build-Dependency and
      --with-libwrap configure argument since libwrap is only used by the
      auditd network listener
  * Dropped changes:
    - debian/auditd.init: apply the intent of Peter Moody's patch to add
      support for rules.d directory for splitting out audit.d rules
      + The new augenrules tool, called from the init script, replaces this
    - debian/control: The upstream audit sources embed and build against their
      own version of libev. This is not desirable, but there's no reason to
      list libev-dev as a build dependency at this time.
      + Debian commented out the libev Build-Dependency
    - debian/patches/FTBFS-python-multiarch.diff: No longer needed
    - debian/patches/fix-asprintf-warnings.patch,
      debian/patches/fix-unused-result-warnings.patch
      debian/patches/fix-discards-const-qualifier-warnings.patch: Present in
      upstream release
  * debian/auditd.init: The start command now requires $remote_fs to be
    started because it may call /bin/augenrules, which depends on
    /usr/bin/awk. $PATH must also be updated so that augenrules can find awk.

audit (1:2.2.2-1ubuntu2) raring; urgency=low

  * Disable auditd network listener with --disable-listener (LP: #1026852)
    - debian/rules: Reduce the risk of a remote attack on auditd, which
      runs as root, by not building the code that listens for audit messages
      over the network. This will prevent users from using auditd as a
      centralized audit message aggregator, but this feature is rarely used.
  * Don't build against libwrap since only auditd's network listener used it
    - debian/control: Remove libwrap0-dev Build-Dependency
    - debian/rules: Remove --with-libwrap from configure arguments
  * Remove libev-dev Build-Dependency (LP: #1026852)
